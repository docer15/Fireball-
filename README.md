Constructing the graph
----------------------
Before I will demonstrate my understanding off all the networking terms that were used in the construction of my graph I will first discuss the process I went about in making the graph. The first step I used was to use the netvizz application which is available on Facebook. Netvizz is a tool that is capable of extracting data and information from different sections on Facebook. The network that that we were using was a personal one so this gathered information about all my friends on Facebook and the friendship connections that were present among them. After saving this data as a gdf file I was able to begin a new graph through the use of Gephi. The purpose of making a graph on Gephi was to show me what groups of friends had the most connections and relationships as well as seeing the friends on Facebook who had hardly any connections. 

Network terms
-------------
The nodes in the network I chose for my graph report represented my friends. When I opened the gdf file in Gephi it was just a square with a large amount of nodes but after using the networking tools available to me on Gephi I was able to establish close connections amongst my friends. There were 1110 nodes present of my graph and this represented the amount of friends I had on Facebook. The term given to the links between all my friends is knows as edges and the number of edges that were present on my graph were 59751. This told me that there were thousands of connections between my friends on this social networking site. Edges can also mean interactions as well as flows of information and goods but in relation to social networking and my graph, edges was in reference to the connections throughout my friends. Throughout my graph on gephi I realised that some connections were stronger than one another. This is known as the influence. I was able to see how there were some very steady connections amongst my graph as we all some distant connections.  

More networking terms
--------------------
Another networking term I came across through the construction of my graph was bridging. Bridging is a direct connection that connects two different groups in a social networking graph. I was able to see this on my graph as there were different groups spread out but there were still direct connections between groups. Every node throughout the graph had a number of different connections which is known as the degree. Some friends had greater amount of connections which made them the active node in my network. I reduced my degree range setting to between 0-50 so I could see who had the most connections out of such a small degree range. This helped me interpret exactly what degree meant and was clearly able to see this on the graph. Betweenness centrality counts the amount of times that a node acts as a connector between the shortest distances between two nodes. Closeness centrality refers to the shortest path information can spread throughout the network. In my networking graph I was able to see the person who was more centred in the graph was generally a lower distance away from all the other nodes. The eigenvector centrality refers to how much influence a node has on a network. A node which has eigenvector centrality usually has a connection to numerous nodes in a network. 
Gephi allowed me to visualize and analyse my networking graph. It showed me the greater connections that were present throughout different cluster of nodes and also demonstrated to me the networking terms that were mentioned above. Once I analysed the networking terms I was able to see a graph at the end which showed me the most influencing nodes as well as the nodes that had the least ties and connections.
